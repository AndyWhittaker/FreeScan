        ECM OVERVEIW
        ------------
          The ECM is the master of  ALDL. When an ALDL tester is used
          to gather ALDL data, it should gain master ship of ALDL by issuing
          a mode 8 to the ECM. Once the tester has gained mastership, it's the
          testers responsibility to schedule and command normal mode messages
          (see normal mode message schedule) from the ECM to maintain normal
          system functionality while gathering ALDL data from any module on
          the data link.

 NORMAL MODE MESSAGE SCHEDULE
 ----------------------------

   MASTER MODULE NORMAL MODE MESSAGES TO BE COMMANDED DURING MODE 1, 2, 3, & 4
   COMMUNICATIONS WITH ANY CONTROLLER ON THE DATA LINK.
   THESE MESSAGES ARE TO BE COMMANDED WITH A MODE 7 COMMAND TO THE MASTER.


      COMMAND ID           LISTEN ID  MES LENGTH

        $0A                  $0A        x            ECM BROADCAST MESSAGE

        $05                  $05        x            ECM BROADCAST MESSAGE


  COMMAND ID: THIS IS THE ID OF THE NORMAL MODE MESSAGE TO BE COMMANDED BY A
              MODE 7 TO THE MASTER.

  LISTEN ID : WHEN THE MODE 7 IS SENT TO THE MASTER, THE MASTER TRANSMITS THE
              REQUESTED NORMAL MODE MESSAGE WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT CAUSE A
              RESPONSE MESSAGE TO BE GENERATED BY ANOTHER MODULE. IN ORDER TO
              MAINTAIN PROPER SYNCHRONIZATION WITH TRAFFIC ON THE DATA LINK, THE
              LISTEN ID SHOULD BE THAT OF THE RESPONSE MESSAGE IF ONE IS
              GENERATED OR THE COMMAND ID IF NO RESPONSE IS GENERATED BY THE
              NORMAL MODE MESSAGE.

  MES LENGTH: IF THE RESPONSE MESSAGE ID IS THE SAME AS THE COMMANDED MESSAGE ID
              THE MESSAGE LENGTH IS USED TO DIFFERENTIATE THE RESPONSE MESSAGE
              FROM THE TRANSMIT MESSAGE.
